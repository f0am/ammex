            The health and safety of our customers is our top priority. Due to <strong>COVID-19</strong>, we are asking clients wishing to drop off documents, to use the letter slot to the right side of the door. A member of our team will be in contact with you in order to ask all the questions we might have. Alternatively, you may email us at <strong>ammextax@gmail.com</strong> with any relevant information for your file.
            If you must pick up your documents, you must book an appointment ahead of time. To do so, call us at <strong>(819) 682-0000</strong> or by email at <strong>ammextax@gmail.com</strong> .
            If you have an appointment, please knock on the door or use the bell and someone will open the door for you.
            Thank you for your understanding in this difficult time. We will be returning to our “normal” way of operations once it is deemed safe for our clients.
